# Frogger-Reboot

This project is currently under development. The present codebase is a close adaptation of Christian Koch's Frogger game implementation. I've uploaded this version as a placeholder due to the unfortunate loss of my original Frogger game data.
I'm planning a comprehensive overhaul of the game while preserving the core gameplay mechanics that define the Frogger experience. I anticipate significant changes to the graphics, sound design, and various game elements in future updates.
In the meantime, I invite you to enjoy the current version of the game. Stay tuned for exciting improvements and a fresh take on this classic arcade favorite!
