## Project Status

This project is currently under development. The present codebase is a close adaptation of Christian Koch's Frogger game implementation. It has been uploaded as a placeholder due to the unfortunate loss of the original Frogger game data. Plans are in place for a comprehensive overhaul of the game while preserving the core gameplay mechanics that define the Frogger experience.

## Description

This is a Python implementation of the classic arcade game Frogger. The game features a player-controlled character that must navigate through traffic and other obstacles to reach its destination.

## Prerequisites

To run this game, you need:
- Python 3.x
- Pygame library

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine using:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yashwanth-Kumar-Kurakula/Frogger-Reboot.git
   ```

2. **Download the Source Code**  
   Alternatively, you can download the source code as a ZIP file and extract it.

3. **Ensure Python is Installed**  
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/).

4. **Install the Pygame Library**  
   Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install Pygame:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

5. **Navigate to the Game Directory**  
   Change the current directory to the location where you have cloned or extracted the game files. For example:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/frogger-reboot
   ```

6. **Run the Game**  
   Execute the `main.py` file to start the game:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Game Controls

- Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to move the character.
- The objective is to guide the character safely across the road and reach the top of the screen.

## Files Structure

- `main.py`: The main game loop and initialization.
- `player.py`: Contains the Player class, handling player movement and animation.
- `car.py`: Defines the Car class for obstacle vehicles.
- `settings.py`: Game settings and constants.
- `sprite.py`: Contains SimpleSprite and LongSprite classes for game objects.

## Future Plans

Significant changes are anticipated in future updates, including:
- Overhauled graphics
- Enhanced sound design
- New game elements and features
- Improved user interface

Stay tuned for exciting improvements and a fresh take on this classic arcade favorite!
